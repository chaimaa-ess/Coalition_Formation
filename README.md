# Coalition_Formation
This code optimizes the energy exchange in a networked Microgrid.

The code is separated into two files:
  1. The main script: LeaderCluster 
  2. The nested function: matching, which is called by the main script

# Papers
## Matching only
The first version of the strategy (containing the matching only) is presented in:
C. Essayeh, M. R. El-Fenni and H. Dahmouni, "Optimal Energy Exchange in Micro-Grid Networks: Cooperative Game Approach," 2018 Renewable Energies, Power Systems & Green Inclusive Economy (REPS-GIE), Casablanca, 2018, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/REPSGIE.2018.8488865.

## Matching + Coalition
And a second version with the coalition formation integrated in:
Essayeh, C., Fenni, M.R. & Dahmouni, H. Optimization of energy exchange in microgrid networks: a coalition formation approach. Prot Control Mod Power Syst 4, 24 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s41601-019-0141-5
